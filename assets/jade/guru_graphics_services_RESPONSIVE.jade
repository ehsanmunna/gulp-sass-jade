				div Having a website which is not browsable from all the mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets is one of the biggest limits for a website owner. Responsiveness means the capacity of a website to <span class="text-bold">smartly adapt itself to every screen resolution</span> or device in order to be <span class="text-bold">browsable from everywhere</span>. In any of our product, responsiveness is guaranteed!
